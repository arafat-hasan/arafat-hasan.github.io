      <description>This writing is actually a draft note made for myself, so that I myself don‚Äôt forget what I had learned. But I think this note will be helpful for those who want to learn Redis.
 1. Introduction to Redis Redis is an acronym for Remote dictionary server. It‚Äôs an open source, in-memory and persistent key-value database / store which stores data as key-value pairs and also doubles up as a message broker.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction to PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
 PostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows.</description>

      <description>1. The Shallow Sea 1.1. PRIMARY KEY The PRIMARY KEY of a table is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraint. Here we will see how to delete and add a primary key.
 At first, we check the table description, and we have found that the id column is a PRIMARY KEY.
 \d person;    Table &amp;#34;public.person&amp;#34; Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default ------------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+------------------------------------ id | bigint | | not null | nextval(&amp;#39;person_id_seq&amp;#39;::regclass) first_name | character varying(50) | | not null | last_name | character varying(50) | | not null | email | character varying(150) | | | gender | character varying(7) | | not null | date_of_birth | date | | not null | country_of_birth | character varying(50) | | not null | Indexes: &amp;#34;person_pkey&amp;#34; PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)   Now we will try to add a duplicate value to the table.</description>

      <description>1. The Surface Sea 1.1. Mockaroo Data Generator We will use a site named Mockaroo to insert a lot of data into our table for our learning convenience. Mockaroo is an online realist test data generator. We will download a bunch of dummy but realistic data in SQL format and execute the SQL file in the terminal.
 
 Notes:
   Field Names and types in Mockaroo according to the image above.</description>
