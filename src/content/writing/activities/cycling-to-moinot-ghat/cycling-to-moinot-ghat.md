The idea was simple: cycle from Dhaka to the banks of the Padma River and back in a day. On May 1, 2025, my friend Abdur Rahim and I turned that idea into reality with a 134-kilometer ride to Moinot Ghat in Munshiganj—a journey that took us through highways, village roads, rainstorms, and darkness.

## The Route

We set out from Dhaka at around 7 AM, cycling through the bustling streets of Puran Dhaka where we stopped for breakfast. Our route took us along the Dhaka-Mawa highway, but we wisely chose the service lane designated for local vehicles. This slower lane proved to be a much safer option—I cannot stress enough how dangerous the fast lane can be for cyclists.

After leaving the highway, we entered the quieter upazila roads that wound through the countryside. Our path led us through Rarikhal village, the birthplace of the legendary polymath Jagadish Chandra Bose. The complete route was: Dhaka → Sreenagar → Moinot Ghat → Ruhitpur → Dhaka.

## Key Highlights

**Rarikhal Village:** This charming village sits right on the banks of the Padma River and holds historical significance as the birthplace of Jagadish Chandra Bose. The peaceful atmosphere and riverside location made it a memorable part of our journey.

**Cottage-Style Houses:** Throughout Munshiganj, we noticed distinctive readymade cottage-style houses that have become iconic to the region. These unique structures feature tin roofs and are designed for portability—they can be disassembled and moved to new locations, a practical innovation suited to the region's geography and lifestyle.

**Moinot Ghat:** Reaching our destination felt like discovering a hidden paradise. The ghat offered direct access to the Padma River, where we spent about an hour bathing in the cool waters—a blissful reward after hours of pedaling under the sun.

**Arial Beel:** On our return journey, we cycled past Arial Beel, a vast lake-like wetland with still waters. Though we passed through in complete darkness, the experience of riding alongside this expansive water body left a lasting impression.

## Memorable Moments

**The River Bath:** After 67 kilometers of cycling, plunging into the Padma River was pure euphoria. We spent nearly an hour in the water, letting the river wash away our fatigue and refresh our spirits for the journey back.

**Hilsha Fish Lunch:** We treated ourselves to a well-deserved feast at a riverside restaurant. The meal of fresh Hilsha fish with rice and various bharta dishes was the perfect fuel, enjoyed with a view of the Padma stretching out before us.

**Caught in the Rain:** As evening approached on our return journey, the sky opened up. Rain drenched us as darkness fell, transforming our ride through Ruhitpur and past Arial Beel into an adventure we hadn't anticipated.

**Cycling Against the Wind:** The headwind after the rain made every pedal stroke a challenge. Cycling against wind is always demanding, but the air was incredibly fresh—clean, oxygen-rich, and cool from the recent downpour. It was exhausting and exhilarating in equal measure.

**The Dark Ride Through the Beel:** Navigating past Arial Beel in complete darkness was both thrilling and slightly frightening. The area was far from any settlement, and concerns about security crossed our minds more than once. Yet there was something primal and liberating about cycling through the darkness with only our lights to guide us.

We finally rolled back into Dhaka around 10 PM, completing our 134-kilometer circuit. Exhausted but triumphant, we had experienced a side of Bangladesh that few see—from the historical villages to the mighty Padma, from the innovative cottage homes to the vast wetlands.

For anyone considering a similar adventure, remember: take the service lane on the highway, embrace the unexpected (like rain and headwinds), and don't rush the journey. The beauty of cycling lies not just in reaching your destination, but in every kilometer pedaled along the way.
