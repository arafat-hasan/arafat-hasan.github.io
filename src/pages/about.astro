    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience building efficient and reliable systems, 
        supported by a strong background in competitive programming with extensive problem-solving expertise. 
        My experience spans backend engineering, DevOps, and machine learning, including work on classification, 
        recommendation, and document review systems. I thrive on tackling complex challenges with clarity, 
        exploring big ideas, and staying curious about everything while pursuing technical excellence with 
        intellectual depth.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Professional Background</h2>
      <p>
        Currently working as a Software Engineer at Dynamic Solution Innovators, I contribute to Envize, 
        Consilio's large-scale document classification and Technology-Assisted Review (TAR) platform used 
        in enterprise eDiscovery workflows. I've developed and maintained core services using Python, Java 
        Spring Boot, and Next.js, handling millions of documents with ML-driven classification pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I interned at MATs Inc. where I contributed to a stock market recommendation system, 
        building web crawlers and scrapers to extract financial data from NASDAQ and other market sources.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Problem Solving Journey</h2>
      <p>
        With over 1500+ algorithmic problems solved across major online judges and participation in 300+ 
        online contests, competitive programming has been a cornerstone of my technical development. I've 
        competed in 15+ national inter-university contests and served as a Competitive Programming Trainer 
        at MBSTU, where I trained students for ICPC and conducted workshops on algorithms and data structures.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Research & Community</h2>
      <p>
        I've published research on intelligent waste management systems using deep learning with IoT in the 
        Journal of King Saud University. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and helping 
        others grow in their technical journey through training, mentorship, and open-source contributions.
