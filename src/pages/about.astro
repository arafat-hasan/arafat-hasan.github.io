                Hi! I'm Arafat — a software engineer who builds efficient and
                reliable systems while staying endlessly curious about the
                world. I thrive on tackling complex technical challenges, but I
                also love exploring big ideas across diverse disciplines.
                Whether it's diving into code or getting lost in a book about
                history or philosophy, I'm always learning and connecting dots.

                    <p>
                        I'm an avid reader with a deep curiosity for big ideas
                        that shape our world. My interests span across history,
                        geopolitics, philosophy, religion, literature, and
                        psychology. I love exploring diverse perspectives and
                        understanding how ideas interconnect across different
                        disciplines.

                    <p>
                        I'm passionate about traveling — not as a tourist
                        checking off landmarks, but as a cultural explorer
                        seeking to understand people and their stories. I've
                        traveled extensively around Bangladesh, immersing myself
                        in local cultures, traditions, and the rich tapestry of
                        human experiences that make each place unique.

                What I Do
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently a Software Engineer at <strong
                    >Dynamic Solution Innovators</strong
                >, working on
                <strong>Envize</strong> — Consilio's large-scale document classification
                and Technology-Assisted Review platform used in enterprise eDiscovery.
                I build and maintain services using Python, Java Spring Boot, and
                Next.js, handling millions of documents with ML-driven pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical experience spans backend engineering, DevOps, and
                machine learning. I also have a strong competitive programming
                background with 1500+ problems solved and have served as a CP
                trainer. I've published research on intelligent waste management
                systems using deep learning with IoT in the Journal of King Saud
                University.
